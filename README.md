Developed a machine learning system for crop classification and recommendation. Utilized various 
algorithms including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors 
(KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Preprocessed and encoded data, 
performed correlation analysis, and evaluated model performance using accuracy scores and 
classification reports.
